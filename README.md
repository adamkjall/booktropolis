Project TODOS:
* Fix so only one card can be flipped, preferably if one
  card is flipped and you click on another one then the
  first card should flip back and at the same time flip
  the new card. So only one card is flipped at any single
  time. (DONE)
* Make a button or a menu button for NYT best sellers, or
  possibly a tab.
* Extends so you can search for any book on the NYT api
  and not just be able to search among the already shown.
* Look into google books api, would be cool to be able to
  search for any book in the world. (DONE)
